# TheRobotToy
Small code example application in React

### TODO :
>  String Commands Panel - required to add a continuous set of steps to move around platform
>  Enzyme tests 
>  Warning / Crash panel when unit is moving off platform ... currently the platform fires up red.
>  Reset Button - currently you need to either re-enter start values or hit the Robot Move commands till you are back on the platform
> Ability to drop more Robots on the grid & restrict collisions


### Setup

Then get up and running with:

```
git clone git@github.com/markwybrow/TheRobotToy.git
cd TheRobotToy
yarn
yarn start
```
